# Graduation project - Distributed and parallel calculations in wave optics models
Problems such as diffraction image computation often require much more than a regular computer, on which it is not possible to obtain a satisfactory solution, which may be a solution with too much error or too long an execution time. MPI and CUDA approaches were used as two possible solutions for this problem, and the code was written in the Fortran programming language. The key part of the work is the speedup that we obtained by applying these two methods, as well as the quality of the diffraction image that we can obtain by applying different methods for the same program execution time.
